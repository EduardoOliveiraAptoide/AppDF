                <full-description>Yandex.Shell is an intuitive interface that makes using Android devices a breeze. It only takes a second to customise the various screens, while the interface automatically sorts your apps and widgets. Simply use the 3D carousel to switch between screens. 
                You can place all your most frequently used widgets on the same screen to keep up-to-date with all the latest local news, weather and traffic. The built-in app search tool will help you easily find an app on your phone or online.
                
                The Yandex.Shell address book also doubles as a business directory. For example, if you search for “restaurant” the app will show you the address and telephone number of restaurants in the area.
                
                If you receive a missed call from an unknown number, Shell will automatically check the business directory for this number and show you the name in your call history if possible.
                
                Yandex.Shell is available as a free download for users in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey.
